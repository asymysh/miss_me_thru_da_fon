Soulja boy wont tell you but your fellow teammates can!


Makeshift Discord bot coded in python utilising Twilio's REST API to call you when youre out cold.    
Feel free to add a star ‚≠ê to the repository if the bot saved your day :_)    
 
Usecase:
  MIT takes surprise quizzes in between online classes. To make sure none of our friends miss it, I made this BOT. The bot basically calls everyone listed on the BOT Database using the Calling feature with Twilio's REST API. There's approximately 80ms delay between each calls and can call only upto 12different numbers at a time (as per the Twilio Fair Usage Policy). The bot is designed to make as many call requests as possible and keeps repeating until the request for that specified number is fulfulled.
 
üë©üñ®Ô∏è Gotta Call 'em All: !gottacallemall to call all the listed numbers on the database.  
‚öôÔ∏è‚úâÔ∏è Ping: !ping to ping the running status
